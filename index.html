                <h2>History of BC Wine</h2>
                <p>Prior to 1990, apart from a few industry pioneers, most of the grapes grown in BC were hybrid,
                    and the growers'focus was on quantity rather than quality. 
                    That all changed with the signing of North America Free Trade Agreement between Canada and United States.
                    With the onset of free trade, the goverment gave the option for growers to remove their vines and plant a different crop.
                    Two-thirds of the 3,400 grapes acreage was removed leaving just 1,134 acres of grapes, only half of which was estimated
                    to vinifera grapes.
                    <br>
                    This launched the subsequent planting of quality vinifera varieties which saw the begining of the modern BC wine industry
                    and the impressive BC wine we enjoy today.
                    <br>
                    Now with 30 years of experience testing different theories and determining
                     the right place for the right grape, the BC wine industry is coming into 
                     its own and creating its own style and personality.
                     <br>
                     That combined with ambition and vine age, comes with wine that continues
                     to gain complexity and the exceptional people who craft them.

                <h3>White</h3>
                <p>Under that skin, the pulpy part of a white grape is the same
                    color as that of a red grape. The skin dictates the end color for red wine, 
                    which differs from the white's color determinates.

                <h3>Red</h3>
                <p>There are countless numbers of red grape varieties in the world,
                    some able to make wine, others suites for the Welch's factory. The wine market 
                    focuses on about 40 - 50 different grape.

                <h3>Rose</h3>
                <p>Technically, a rose is an "unfinished red wine", Rose is defferent
                    sort of wine, with all the refreshing qualities of white wine mixed some characteristics
                    of a red.
